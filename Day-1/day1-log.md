# Day 1: [Insert Topic, e.g., Setting Up & Git Basics]

**Date:** January 2, 2026

### 📝 Daily Summary
Today I officially started the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I focused on setting up my environment and understanding the workflow for the next 100 days.

### 💻 What I Did Today
- Created the main repository for the challenge.
- Set up a structured folder system (Day-1 folder).
- Configured my `README.md` to track my daily progress.
- [Optional: Learned how to use basic Git commands like push/commit].

### 💡 Key Learnings
- Learned that Git doesn't track empty folders (used a `.gitkeep` or log file instead).
- Understood the importance of consistent daily pushes for the GitHub contribution graph.

### 🚩 Challenges Overcome
- Figured out how to create folders directly on the GitHub web interface.
