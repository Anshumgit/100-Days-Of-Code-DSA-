Day 4: Queue & Stack Conversions + Gas Station Problem

Date: January 5, 2026

📝 Daily Summary
Day 4 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge focused on mastering data structure transformations and solving a classic greedy algorithm problem. I implemented Queue using Stack, Stack using Queue, and solved the Gas Station circular tour problem efficiently.

💻 What I Did Today

Implemented Queue using two Stacks

Used stack reversal technique to maintain FIFO order

Implemented Stack using two Queues

Reordered queue elements to simulate LIFO behavior

Solved the Gas Station (Circular Tour) problem

Used greedy approach with balance and deficit tracking

Pushed clean, working C++ code to GitHub

💡 Key Learnings

Stack and Queue operations can be interchanged using auxiliary data structures

Maintaining order is the key challenge in Stack ↔ Queue conversions

The Gas Station problem can be solved in O(n) time using a single pass

Tracking deficit + balance is crucial to validating the starting point

🚩 Challenges Overcome

Avoided unnecessary edge-case failures in dequeue/pop operations

Understood why resetting balance is important in the Gas Station solution

Improved confidence in implementing interview-level DSA problems
