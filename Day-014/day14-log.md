📅 Day 14 – Binary Search & Tree Traversals

100 Days of Code Challenge

Date: January 15, 2026

✅ Problems Solved
🔍 Binary Search Based

Find Peak Element (LeetCode)

Used binary search to locate a peak in O(log n) time.

Find in Mountain Array (LeetCode)

Found peak using binary search.

Applied order-agnostic binary search on both sides of the peak.

🌳 Binary Tree Traversals

Vertical Order Traversal of Binary Tree (GeeksforGeeks)

Used level order traversal with horizontal distance mapping.

Zigzag Tree Traversal (GeeksforGeeks)

Level order traversal with alternating left-to-right and right-to-left insertion.

🧠 Concepts Practiced

⚙️ Time & Space Complexity
Problem	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
Find Peak Element	O(log n)	O(1)
Find in Mountain Array	O(log n)	O(1)
Vertical Order Traversal	O(n)	O(n)
Zigzag Traversal	O(n)	O(n)
💡 Key Learnings

Binary search can be extended beyond sorted arrays.

Mountain array problems combine multiple binary search patterns.

BFS is ideal for level-wise tree problems.

Mapping horizontal distance simplifies vertical traversal.

Zigzag traversal can be handled cleanly using index manipulation.

📈 Progress Reflection

Today strengthened my understanding of advanced binary search patterns and tree traversal techniques. I’m getting more confident in combining multiple concepts within a single problem—especially useful for interview-level questions.
